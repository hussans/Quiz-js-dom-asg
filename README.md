**Review**: The code is concise and meets the design requirements of the challenge(although it does allow a wider color range than that listed in the description). The use of .style was insightful. It greatly reduced the amount of extra lines of code, and made the code more versatile. The only potential issue is that this goes beyond the scope of the assignment. It allows virtually limitless color options, and its possible that the challenge's design specifications want the range of colors to be limited to the the ones listed in the description. Very impressive. Great use of alerts to limit unwanted input. Consider using placeholder text for the input field and limiting the legth of input using the placeholder and maxlength attributes.
